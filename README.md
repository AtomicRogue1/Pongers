# Pongers!
A classic Pong game with a few twists created using Godot 4 Engine. This project demonstrates basic game mechanics and implementation of enemy AI using finite state automata in Godot.

## Features
- Ball movement and collision detection
- Simple scoring system
- Enemy AI made using finite state automata

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AtomicRogue1/Pongers.git
   ```
2.  Open the project in Godot Engine (make sure you have Godot Engine installed). As I used C# for the code, I recommend installing the latest .NET SDK.
3.  Run the project by pressing F5 or clicking the "Play" button in the Godot editor.
